As a concert photographer, you need a setup that can keep up with a fast-paced and often chaotic environment. Here are some productivity tools and aesthetic improvements I use that help improve my workflow efficiency.

## Productivity Tools

These tools help me finish my overnight edits faster so I can get to sleep sooner ðŸ˜´

### [Drop Over](https://dropoverapp.com/) - A Better Way to Move Files

We deal with moving files all the time and there's no built in solution for bulk moving files from different sources. This app provides you with a virtual area to drop files and move all of them together.

### [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) - Keep Your MacBook Awake

You don't want your MacBook falling asleep in the middle of uploading all your raw clips over shitty hotel wifi, do you? This app lets you set custom never sleep rules while certain apps are running.

### [Usage](https://usage.pro/) - Monitor Your MacBook Performance

Get real-time information about your MacBook's performance. Really easy way to keep an eye on your device, all on one screen.

### Dropbox/Google Drive - Access Your Files Anywhere

You probably already have these installed, but if you don't I'll gladly be the one to change your life.

Instead of waiting for all your photos and videos to finish exporting and then uploading through the web interface, just set your media export destination to a folder on your computer and have these apps automatically sync/upload the files for you. This way you can upload files while your media is still exporting.

Essential for any concert photographer or videographer.

## âœ¨Aestheticâœ¨ Improvements

While appearance may not be the most important factor, a clean and organized workspace can definitely help you stay focused.

### [Tiles](https://freemacsoft.net/tiles/) - Easily Organize Windows

After switching from Windows to Mac last year, I got quickly frustrated with manually resizing windows. Tiles adds Window's easy window alignment to Mac since Tim Apple still hasn't figured it out.

### [Top Notch](https://topnotch.app/) - Hide the Notch

Makes the notch disappear. That is all.

### [Hidden Bar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066?mt=12) - Hide the Menu Bar

Considering my laptop background is just a solid black color, it's safe to say I like overly optimizing my workspace. This is a perfect way to hide all the menu bar icons.
