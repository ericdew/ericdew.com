## Productivity Tools

Free tools that help me finish my overnight edits faster so I can sleep sooner ðŸ˜´

### [Drop Over](https://dropoverapp.com/) - A Better Way to Move Files

There's no built-in solution for bulk moving files from different sources. This app provides you with a virtual area to drop files and move all of them together.

### [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) - Keep Your MacBook Awake

If you don't want your laptop falling asleep in the middle of exporting and uploading all your raw clips over ðŸ’© hotel wifi, this app prevents your laptop from sleeping while certain apps are running.

Personally, I set triggers for Lightroom, Resolve, and Dropbox.

### [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/desktop) and [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/download/) - Access Your Files Anywhere

Instead of waiting for all your photos and videos to finish exporting and _then_ uploading through the web interface, just set your media export destination to a folder on your computer and have these apps automatically sync/upload the files for you while your media is still exporting.

Essential for any concert photographer or videographer.

### [Usage](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1561788435) - Monitor Your MacBook Performance

For those who want real-time performance stats. ðŸ¤“

## âœ¨Aestheticâœ¨ Improvements

While appearance may not be the most important factor, a clean and organized workspace helps me stay focused.

### [Tiles](https://freemacsoft.net/tiles/) - Easily Organize Windows

After switching from Windows to Mac last year, I got frustrated quickly with manually resizing windows. Tiles adds easy window alignment to Mac since Tim Apple still hasn't figured it out.

### [Top Notch](https://topnotch.app/) - Hide the Notch

Makes the notch disappear. That's it.

### [Hidden Bar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hidden-bar/id1452453066) - Hide Menu Bar Icons

If you're like me and enjoy over-optimizing your workspace, this is a perfect way to hide all the menu bar icons.
